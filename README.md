# HTTP and API Project

This repository is a small project designed to practice understanding and interacting with APIs and HTTP while working with foundational concepts in client-server communication.
The project focuses on using Postman to interact with public APIs like PokeAPI and the Spaceflight News API, and creating a simple C# application to consume API data.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to:

- Understand the client-server model and the roles of clients and servers in communication.
- Explain HTTP and the request-response cycle, including how HTTP facilitates communication between systems.
- Recognize the value of APIs as a means to solve data-sharing and interaction problems.
- Understand and use the main HTTP verbs—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE—and their purposes.
- Use Postman to make HTTP requests, interact with public APIs, and inspect responses.
- Create a basic C# application to consume public APIs using the HttpClient class.
- Include credentials in HTTP headers to authenticate requests
